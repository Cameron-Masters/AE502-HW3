# AE502-HW3
This is the repository for homework #3. In this repository, there are the functions CalcEA and sv_from_coe.
Also inside delaunay_orbit, the function 'orbit' can be found. CalcEA is used to calculate the eccentric anomaly given the mean anomaly and eccentricity.
The function sv_from_coe is used to convert the orbital elements (solved for on paper) to the state vector.
The function 'orbit' is at the bottom of delaunay_orbit, and is the function used to determine the orbit. The figure produced is the motion of the satellite.
